# Rent4Hire
Rowan Fall 2022 Senior Project

The purpose of our Rent4Hire is to allow users to rent goods and services. Users can login or sign-up using an email address or Google OAuth. Users provide their personal information for liability reasons. Any user can rent or provide rentals. Rental can be found based on GPS location or address and rentals can be sorted by distance. Other features include selecting a time to pick-up/drop-off, rental history, a chat system, and reviews.
